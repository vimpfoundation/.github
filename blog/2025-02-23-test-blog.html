I spent far to long working on this website for it to be on any level worth it.
Im planning to get a domain name for it. Something like, vimp.dev or vimp.org. Something simple...
Currently no-one wants to use this and im solo developing the entire progect which is driving me slightly insane.
But hey! no one cares about my mental health no! After i deleted the stylesheet on the OG site I was really pissed off.
But I think im fine now... after all I did rewrite EVERYTHING for this site! and build a blogging system! Im kinda pissed i havent done this sooner
and its defenitly dumb but I dont care "Tim" from accounting I can do whatever the fuck I want.
